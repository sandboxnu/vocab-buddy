## Introduction
Vocab buddy is a web application that identities challenging words and creates corresponding learning interventions to young children expand their vocabulary development. It consists of 8 sessions of assessments and interventions to best track children's progress through out study. The project is developed with React and Typescript, as well as firebase to store research data.

The application is currently developed and maintained by [Sandbox](https://www.sandboxnu.com), Northeastern's student-led software consultancy.

### Assessments
Assessments are the quizzes/tests that a child will take before a set of interventions. They identity the skill gaps and chidlren' vocabulary knowledge. Each assessment consists of more than 10 wrods, where a child needs to select the best picture that matches the given word.


### Interventions
Interventions are different activities that the application incorporates to help children practice challenging words. Each of the four types of activities focuses on a unique category:
1. Definition
2. Example
3. Context
4. Review

### Current Goals
As the application is still under development, the goals for this semester are:
1. Complete Assessment and Interventions
2. Create a dashboard to view current progress
3. Support researcher's profile: a place for the researcher to check children's basic information

## Research/Reference
This is a research project proposed by Dr. Robert Volpe, Dr. Suan Rattan, and Dr. Jenlyn Furey.
